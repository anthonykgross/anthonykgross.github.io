      I did too many things! From accounting to web development,
      I spent my days to create a solution to analyze visitors
      behaviors from websites based on their activities without
      any personal data following GDPR regulations. A great challenge! <br/>
      My first aim was to develop a tracker as light and powerful as
      possible to ease its implementation. It has to be customizable to catch events on demand. My second goal was to create a dashboard to deliver our analysis
      and let our customers personalize their trackers.
      Finally, every project has to be in real time.

      (Brightness, location, etc.) and the second one was to
      develop from scratch, a website helping astronomers to
      know if one star belongs to a given groups of star
